<strong>About Me:</strong><br>
Hi I'm Brian Mont,

I am from North Jersey a few miles from New York City, but now live in Philadelphia, PA.

<br>
<strong>College Education:</strong><br>
I graduated from The College of New Jersey in May 2011 with a BS in Business Administration, and a minor in Finance.

<br>
<strong>Professional Experience</strong><br>
Since then, I had a position in sales of industrial & packaging materials for about 6 months. I quickly moved into a new position selling energy commodities to commercial customers. Over the past 5 years I have worked as an account executive and operations officer for an energy consulting company. The company serves more than 200 clients with representation in almost every industry.

<br>
<strong>Entry to Web Development:</strong><br>
Around Dec 2015/Jan 2016 I decided to toy around with some web development. The initial motivation came from a desire to build some applications for my clients to utilize. I learned basic JS, HTML, CSS from some self teaching books and free web resources. After building a few static sites, I decided to join a bootcamp. I chose <a href="bloc.io" target="_blank">Bloc</a> and I am almost completed with my Web Development course.
<br>
I have learned and built applications with many languages, frameworks, and libraries. These include HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, Ruby, AngularJS, Rails, Git, Bash, JSON, React, Redux, and more.

<br>
<strong>Objective:</strong><br>
To work for a quality company as a front end web developer where I will have an opportunity to use and develop my skills for the benefit of the company.
